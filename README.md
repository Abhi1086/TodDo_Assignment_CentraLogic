Created  a ToDO App using React 

This is the Todo Page at first , having a input text field for giving a todo as well as 
a button to add those todo's 

![1 Todo](https://github.com/Abhi1086/TodDo_Assignment_CentraLogic/assets/88306369/5c7f1615-0696-4b17-b0d8-a5f6b5730c04)



## Now After writing and clicking onto the +(Plus) button adds the todo to the TODO List 

-- Within the list of Todo there is a delete feature is also facilitated 

![2_ Todo](https://github.com/Abhi1086/TodDo_Assignment_CentraLogic/assets/88306369/cfba27a5-0c29-49bf-9de9-9d73da2d3239)


## Now if we want to remove the todo from the list wihtin the list delete/Trash bin icon can be clicked to remove todo
